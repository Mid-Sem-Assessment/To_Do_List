Explanation:
HTML Structure:

The HTML defines the basic structure of the To-Do app.
It includes an input field to add tasks, a button to add tasks to the list, and an unordered list to display the tasks.
The necessary CSS and JavaScript files are linked.
CSS Styling:

CSS is used to style the app, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
It styles the container, headings, input field, button, and task list.
JavaScript Functionality:

The addTask() function is called when the "Add" button is clicked.
It retrieves the task input value, creates a new list item (<li>), sets its text content to the task input value, and appends it to the task list.
It also checks if the input field is empty and displays an alert if so.
Conclusion:
This simple To-Do app allows users to add tasks dynamically and displays them in a list format. It's a basic example of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to create interactive web applications. You can further extend this project by adding features like marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, or storing tasks in the browser's local storage for persistence.
